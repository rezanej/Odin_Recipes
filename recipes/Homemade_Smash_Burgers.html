    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This <strong>Smash Burger</strong> recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>

        <li>4 hambuger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softned, or as needed</li>
